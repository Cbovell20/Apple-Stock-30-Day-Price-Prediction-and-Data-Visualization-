# Apple-Stock-30-Day-Price-Prediction-and-Data-Visualization-
My first project using python to create a linear regression model and visualizations to see how Apple is doing. I hope to do more projects and so far working with stocks are pretty fun so enjoy 
# I believe that you will not be able to see the graphs I made using plotly but overall this should show you the process and the code to make these graphs.
